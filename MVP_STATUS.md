## 📊 Test Results

### API Endpoints (All Passing)
- ✅ `GET /` - API info
- ✅ `GET /health` - Health check (database + E2B)
- ✅ `GET /workflows` - List workflows (1 workflow)
- ✅ `GET /workflows/1` - Get workflow details
- ✅ `POST /workflows` - Create workflow
- ✅ `PUT /workflows/{id}` - Update workflow
- ✅ `DELETE /workflows/{id}` - Delete workflow
- ✅ `POST /workflows/1/execute` - Execute workflow (with credential loading)
- ✅ `GET /executions` - List executions (4 executions)
- ✅ `GET /executions/{id}` - Get execution details
- ✅ `GET /executions/{id}/chain` - View Chain of Work

### Workflow Execution
- ✅ **Execution ID 2**: Complete success (8 nodes, 18.17s)
  - Email read → PDF extracted → Text extracted → Amount found (€2,500) → High budget path → Email sent → Database saved

- ✅ **Execution ID 4**: Complete success (5 nodes, 7.75s)
  - Email read → No PDF → Rejection path → Email sent

### Database Tables
- ✅ `workflows` - 1 workflow loaded
- ✅ `executions` - 4 executions tracked
- ✅ `chain_of_work` - 27 entries saved
- ✅ `clients` - 1 client (idom)
- ✅ `client_email_credentials` - 1 record

## 🚀 Ready for Railway Deployment

### Files Prepared
- ✅ `Procfile` - Web server configuration
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All dependencies listed
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` - Step-by-step deployment guide
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variable template

### Required Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - Automatically provided by Railway PostgreSQL
- `E2B_API_KEY` - User must add manually

### Deployment Steps
1. Create Railway project
2. Add PostgreSQL database
3. Set `E2B_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Deploy via `railway up` or Git push
5. Run database migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
6. Load initial data: `python3 scripts/load_invoice_workflow.py`

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Execution Times (Execution ID 2)
- **Total**: 18.17s
- `read_and_extract`: 3.01s
- `extract_text`: 6.60s (PDF processing)
- `find_amount`: 2.31s
- `check_budget`: 2.62s
- `send_high_budget_email`: 1.81s
- `save_invoice`: 1.77s

### Database Performance
- Workflow load: < 10ms
- Execution create: < 20ms
- ChainOfWork save: < 15ms per entry
- Context serialization: Negligible

---

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Credentials stored in database (encrypted at rest by PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Code execution in isolated E2B sandbox
- ✅ No secrets in code or Git repository
- ✅ Environment variables for API keys
- ✅ Database connection pooling with automatic retry

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate (Monthly)

- **Railway PostgreSQL**: $5-10
- **Railway Web Service**: $5-10
- **E2B Code Interpreter**: $0.10-0.50 (development usage)

**Total**: ~$10-20/month

---

## 🎯 What Works

### Full Workflow Execution
The invoice processing workflow successfully:
1. Connects to email via IMAP
2. Reads unread messages from whitelist
3. Extracts PDF attachments
4. Extracts text from PDF using PyMuPDF
5. Detects amounts using regex
6. Makes decisions based on business logic
7. Sends emails via SMTP
8. Saves data to PostgreSQL
9. Records complete audit trail

### API Usage Example
```bash
# Execute workflow with automatic credential loading
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/workflows/1/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_slug": "idom"}'

# Get execution details
curl https://your-app.railway.app/executions/4

# View chain of work
curl https://your-app.railway.app/executions/4/chain
```
